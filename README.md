# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my first step/project on a journey in web development. I needed a place to store my notes throughout the prework assignments, a simple Word document might suffice but I wanted hands-on experience. The experience came with challenges and triumphs, most of which came from finding and fixing my own mistakes. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one topic for you to study first
